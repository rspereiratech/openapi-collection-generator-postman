# Publishing

This module publishes:

- **SNAPSHOT artifacts** to the Sonatype Central Portal on every push to
  `master`, via [`snapshot.yml`](../.github/workflows/snapshot.yml).
- **Release artifacts** (signed, tagged versions) to Maven Central when a
  `v*` tag is pushed, via [`release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml).

## Coordinates

- **Group ID** — `io.github.rspereiratech`
- **Artifact ID** — `openapi-collection-generator-postman`
- **Version** — `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` (current)

## SNAPSHOT publishing

### Where SNAPSHOTs live

- **Repository URL** —
  <https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/>
- Public read access (no auth needed to download).

### Triggers

- Every push to `master`.
- Manual run via `workflow_dispatch`.

The workflow refuses to deploy if the project version does not end with
`-SNAPSHOT`, to avoid accidentally pushing a release through this pipeline.

### Consuming SNAPSHOTs

This module's `pom.xml` declares only the dependency coordinates; the
`-SNAPSHOT` resolution is handled by [`ci-settings.xml`](../ci-settings.xml),
which adds the Sonatype snapshot repository to Maven's resolution path.

For **local builds**, either:

- Invoke Maven with the project's settings file:
  ```bash
  mvn --settings ci-settings.xml clean verify
  ```
- Or copy the `profile` / `server` blocks from `ci-settings.xml` into
  your `~/.m2/settings.xml` so resolution works without the `--settings`
  flag.

## Release publishing

Releases are signed with GPG and published through the Sonatype
`central-publishing-maven-plugin` configured in the parent's `release`
profile. The release flow:

1. Bump `<version>` in `pom.xml` from `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` to e.g. `1.0.0`.
2. Commit and push to `master`.
3. Tag and push: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`.
4. The [`release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow runs:
   - Imports the GPG private key from secrets.
   - Runs `mvn -Prelease deploy`, which attaches sources + javadoc jars,
     GPG-signs all artefacts, and uploads through the Central Publishing
     plugin. With `autoPublish=true` the deployment is promoted to the
     public release repository without manual intervention.
5. Bump back to the next `-SNAPSHOT` (e.g. `1.1.0-SNAPSHOT`) in a follow-up
   commit.

## Required secrets

Configure these in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** on this
repository.

| Secret | Used by | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `CENTRAL_USERNAME` | snapshot + release | Central Portal → View Account → Generate User Token → username |
| `CENTRAL_PASSWORD` | snapshot + release | Same place — password portion |
| `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` | release | `gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <key-id>` |
| `GPG_PASSPHRASE` | release | Passphrase used when generating the GPG key |

## Notes and limitations

- **Parent POM resolution.** Maven resolves the `<parent>` element before
  it reads any `<repositories>` block in the consuming `pom.xml`. The
  parent therefore must be resolvable from `settings.xml` repositories
  (which `ci-settings.xml` provides) or from the local repository.
- **Snapshot reads are public.** No authentication is required to download
  SNAPSHOTs from the Central Portal snapshot URL.
- **Snapshot writes are tokenised.** Uploading requires the
  `CENTRAL_USERNAME` / `CENTRAL_PASSWORD` user-token credentials.
- **Cross-repo coordination.** A change in this repository that depends on
  unreleased code in the parent or core module must wait for those repos
  to publish their own SNAPSHOTs before this one's CI passes. Merge the
  upstream change first, wait for its `snapshot.yml` to succeed, then
  rebase this PR.
- **Releases are irreversible.** A version published to Maven Central
  cannot be removed or overwritten. Verify the release locally
  (`mvn -Prelease verify`) before tagging.
